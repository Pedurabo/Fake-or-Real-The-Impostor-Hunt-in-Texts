## 📊 **PHASE 1: SUBMISSION LOADING & VALIDATION**

### **Submission Files Processed**
1. **`ensemble_submission.csv`** - Phase 2.5 basic ensemble
2. **`advanced_ensemble_submission.csv`** - Phase 3 advanced ensemble

### **Validation Process**
- **File Existence Check**: Verify all submission files are present
- **Format Validation**: Ensure CSV structure matches competition requirements
- **Data Integrity**: Validate prediction counts and ID ranges
- **Load Success**: Track successful loading of each submission

---

## 🔍 **PHASE 2: AGREEMENT ANALYSIS**

### **Cross-Submission Comparison**
- **Agreement Calculation**: Percentage of articles with matching predictions
- **Disagreement Analysis**: Identify articles with different predictions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze disagreement patterns and frequencies
- **Sample Examples**: Show specific cases of disagreement for insight

### **Agreement Metrics**
```
Agreement % = (Matching Predictions / Total Articles) × 100
Disagreement % = 100 - Agreement %
```

---

## 🔗 **PHASE 3: FINAL ENSEMBLE OPTIMIZATION**

### **Ensemble Strategy**
The final ensemble uses a **voting-based approach** to combine all submissions:

```python
# Collect predictions from all submissions
predictions = []
for name in submission_names:
    sub = self.submissions[name]
    sub_row = sub[sub['id'] == article_id]
    if len(sub_row) > 0:
        predictions.append(sub_row.iloc[0]['real_text_id'])

# Simple voting: most common prediction wins
from collections import Counter
prediction_counts = Counter(predictions)
final_prediction = prediction_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

### **Ensemble Features**
- **Prediction Confidence**: Number of submissions contributing to final prediction
- **Submissions Used**: Total number of submissions in ensemble
- **Voting Mechanism**: Majority voting for final decision

---

## 📤 **PHASE 4: COMPETITION SUBMISSION GENERATION**

### **Final Submission Format**
```csv
id,real_text_id

1068,2
```

### **Submission Characteristics**
