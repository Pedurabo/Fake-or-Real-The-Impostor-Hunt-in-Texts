# 🚀 Optimized Pipeline for Fake Text Detection

## Overview
This optimized pipeline breaks down the fake text detection task into **small, manageable clusters** and uses **fast training methods** to dramatically reduce training time while maintaining high accuracy.

## 🎯 Key Optimizations

### 1. **Task Breakdown into Clusters**
- **Data Clustering**: Uses MiniBatchKMeans to group similar texts into 5 clusters
- **Pattern Discovery**: Each cluster reveals different characteristics of fake vs. real texts
- **Reduced Complexity**: Smaller, focused datasets for faster processing

### 2. **Fast Training Algorithms**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Fast similarity-based classification
- **Decision Trees**: Interpretable and extremely fast training
- **Random Forest**: Fast ensemble with parallel processing
- **Logistic Regression**: Fast linear classification
- **Lightweight Neural Network**: Reduced epochs (10 instead of 100+)

### 3. **Association Rules Mining**
- **Feature Relationships**: Discovers patterns between text characteristics
- **Binary Encoding**: Converts features to binary for fast pattern mining
- **Confidence Scoring**: Identifies the most reliable feature combinations

### 4. **Smart Feature Selection**
- **Mutual Information**: Selects only the top 15 most important features
- **Cluster Integration**: Adds cluster information as a feature
- **Standardization**: Fast scaling for better model performance
